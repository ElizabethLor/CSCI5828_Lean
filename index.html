				<section>
					<h2>History</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Henry Ford was the first person to truly integrate an entire production process</li>
						<li>Henry focused on consistently interchangeable parts with standard work and moving conveyance to create what he called flow production.</li>
						<li>The problem with Ford's system was his inability to provide variety.</li>
						<li>Ford's Work: He lined up fabrication steps to fabricate and assemble the components going into the Model T vehicle.</li>
						<li>The problem was that the Model T was limited to one color and one specification ending, which made all Model T chassis looking identical.</li>

				<section>
					<h2>History Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Taiichi Ohno and the others at Toyota looked into Ford's situation.</li>
						<li>It occurred to them that a series of simple innovations might make it more possible to provide both continuity in process flow and a wide variety in product offerings.</li>
						<li>They revisited Ford's original thinking and invented the <u>Toyota Production System.</u></li>
						<ul>
							<li>The focus of the manufacturing engineer is switched from individual machines and their utilization to the flow of the product through the total process.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Thus, the creation of the lean manufacturing model was created.</li>

					<h2>Definition</h2>
					<p>The Lean Model is:</p>
					<p>"A customer-centric methodology used to continuously improve any process through the elimination of waste in everything you do"</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Lean Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>It's based on the ideas of "Continuous Incremental Improvement" and "Respect for People".</li>
						<li>Lean considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination.</li>
						<li>"Value" is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for.</li>
						<li>It's centered around preserving value with less work.</li>
						<li>Lean model decides what matters rather than uncritically accepting pre-existing ideas.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The Term <i>Lean</i></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>In 1990, Daniel Jones and James Womack published <i>The Machine That Changed the World</i> coining the phrase "lean"</li>
						<li><i>The Machine That Changed the World</i> and their subsequent book <i>Lean Thinking</i> further distilled the definition and the five principles of lean manufacturing</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><h2>II. Principles</h2></section>

				<section>
				<h2>Lean Principles</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>Used for guiding the implementation of lean techniques.<p>
						<center><img height="500" src="images/Lean.jpg"></center>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Step 1: Identify Value</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Define <font color="red">value</font> from the customer perspective and express the value in terms of specific product or service.</li>
						<li>Value is determined by the customers who want to buy the right product with the right capabilities at the right price.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This means that the process must be "right" every time.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Work on making their processes right by eliminating waste.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Step 2: Map the Value Stream</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><font color="red">Map</font> all of the steps, value added and non-value added that bring a product or service to the customer.</li>
						<li>Steps that do not create value are eliminated.</li>
						<li>Detailed process flow diagram should be generated for each product or product category.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Step 3: Create Flow</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>A continuous <font color="red">flow</font> of products, services and information from the end to end.</li>
						<li>Make the value creating steps occur in tight sequence so the product will flow smoothly toward the customer.</li>
						<li>Specific process waste is identified at each stage of the process flow and is eliminated.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Create Flow Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Lean enterprise implements 5S - A tool developed for reducing the clack hidden in manufacturing process.</li>
						<ol>
							<li><b>Sort:</b> sorting or segregating through the contents of the workplace and removing all unnecessary items</li>
							<li><b>Straighten:</b> putting or arranging the necessary items in their place and providing easy access by clear identification</li>
							<li><b>Shine:</b> cleaning everything, keeping it clean and using cleaning to inspect the workplace and equipment for defects</li>
							<li><b>Standardize:</b> creating visual controls and guidelines for keeping the workplace organized, orderly and clean, in other words, maintain the shine</li>
							<li><b>Sustain:</b> instituting training and discipline to ensure that everyone flows the 5S standards</li>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Step 4: Establish Pull</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Actual demands <font color="red">pulls</font> product/service through the value stream</li>
						<li>Nothing is done by the upstream process until the downstream customer signals the need.</li>
						<li>As flow is introduced, it lets customers pull value from the next upstream activity.</li>
						<li>This step can be directed toward either removing excess capacity (inventory) or increasing the rate of pull.</li>
						<li>A pull system, which on the production side is making a product at the same rate at which it is being sold.</li>
						<li>On the supply side, a pull system is flowing resources into a production process by replacing only what has been consumed.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Step 5: Seek Perfection</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The completed elimination of waste so all activities create value for the customer by breakthrough and <font color="red">continuous improvement</font> projects.</li>
						<li>As value is specified, value streams are identified, wasted steps are removed, and flow and pull are introduced, begin the process again and continue it until a state of perfection is reached in which perfect value is created with no waste.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><h2>III. Lean and Software Development</h2></section>

				<section>
					<h2>Lean Software Development</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Authors Mary and Tom Poppendieck wrote a book title <i>Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit</i> which presents the lean principles and compares them to traditional agile tools.</li>
						<li>Lean software development is the application of lean principles to the craft of software development.</li>
						<li>The goals are to develop software in 1/3 the time, with 1/3 the budget, and with 1/3 the defect rate.</li>
						<li>Applying the lean method to software development produces 7 principles of its own.</li>
					</ul>
					<center><img height="250" src="images/Poppendieck_Book.jpg"></center>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Eliminate Waste</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>3 general forms of waste identified by the Toyota Production System</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Muda - unproductive</li>
							<li>Mura - unevenness, inconsistency</li>
							<li>Muri - over burden, unreasonableness</li>
						</ul>
						<li>There are 7 types of waste:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Over Production</li>
							<li>Unnecessary Transportation</li>
							<li>Inventory</li>
							<li>Motion</li>
							<li>Defects</li>
							<li>Over Processing</li>
							<li>Waiting</li>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Eliminate Waste Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Manufacturing verses Software Waste</li>
						<li>It's important to learn to see and understand the wastes of software development</li>
						<center><img src="images/manufacturingvssoftwarewaste.png" </center>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Eliminate Waste Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Everything that does not add value to the customer is waste, such as</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Unnecessary code or functionality</li>
							<li>Slow or ineffective communication</li>
							<li>Defects and quality issues</li>
							<li>Unclear or constantly changing requirements</li>
						</ul>
						<li>In order to eliminate waste, one should be able to recognize it.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If some activity could be bypassed or the result could be achieved without it, it is waste.</li>
							<li>If the partially done code is abandoned during the development process, it is waste.</li>
						</ul>
						<li><u>Waste removal</u> should take place iteratively until seemingly essential processes and procedures are liquidated.</li>
					</ul>  
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Increase Feedback</h2>
					<strong>Amplify Learning</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>This is the best approach for improving a software development environment.</li>
						<li>Instead of adding more documentation or detailed planning, different ideas could be tried by writing code and building.</li>
						<li>Learning process is sped up by usage of short iteration cycles</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Each iteration is coupled with refactoring and integration testing.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>During these short iterations, both customer representatives and the development team learn more about the domain problem and figure out possible solution for further development.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This helps the customer better understand their needs based on the existing result of development efforts.</li>
							<li>The developers learns how to better satisfy those needs.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>	
					<h2>Increase Feedback Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Tools to help include constant feedback and tests that are not overly documented or studied but tried and observed</li>
						<li>Short iterations are also helpful to keep the team constantly working and learning</li>
						<li>Synchronization test that requires daily testing and high level of communication</li>
						<li>Set based development, which focuses on communicating constraints and options to find solutions</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Delay Commitment</h2>
					<strong>Decide As Late As Possible</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Better results should be achieved with an options based approach, delaying decisions as much as possible until they can be made based on facts and not on uncertain assumptions and predictions.</li>
						<li>The more complex a system is, the more capacity for change should be built into it.</li>
						<li>This does not mean that no planning should be involved.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Planning activities should be concentrated on the different options and adapting to the current situation as well as clarifying confusing situations by establishing patterns for rapid action.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Delay Commitment Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Know what is critically important for the domain</li>
						<li>Practice Object Oriented Design</li>
						<li>Options Thinking - build with options in mind</li>
						<img src="images/decidelate.jpg">
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Deliver Fast</h2>
					<strong>Deliver As Fast As Possible</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The sooner the end product is delivered without major defects, the sooner feedback can be received and incorporated into the next iteration.</li>
						<li>The shorter the iterations, the better the learning and communication within the team.</li>
						<li>With speed, decisions can be delayed.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Speed assures the fulfilling of the customer's present needs and not what they required yesterday.</li>
							<li>Gives them the opportunity to delay making up their minds about what they really require until they gain better knowledge.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Customers value rapid delivery of a quality product.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Build Integrity In</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Pair Programming</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Seeks to avoid quality issues by applying the minds of two developers to each task.</li>
							<li>Combined the experience of two developers instead of one.</li>
							<li>Often results in better productivity as they see solutions that on their own they might not have done.</li>
							<li>Improved quality, since one person can be thinking slightly ahead of the other, catching issues before they occur.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Test Driven Development</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Write the tests before writing the code.</li>
							<li>This prevent quality issues from happening.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Build Integrity in Con't</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Perceived Integrity is affected by the customer's whole experience of a system</li>
							<ul><li>Smaller systems developed by a single team with access, short iterations, customer tests</li></ul>
							<li>Conceptual Integrity means that the system's central concepts work together as a smooth cohesive whole</li>
							<ul><li>Remove complexity in the design and use integrated problem solving to understand the problem and solve the problem at the same time</li></ul>
							<center><img src="images/integrity.jpg"></center>
						</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Build Integrity In Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Constant Feedback</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Develop in small incremental steps and through close collaboration.</li>
							<li>This provide the opportunity for constant 2-way feedback between the Product Owner and the team.</li>
							<li>This feedback can be valuable to ensure the right level of quality.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Minimize Time Between Stages</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Building quality into the development process is to minimize the time between development, testing and bug fixing.</li>
							<li>Do not log the bug. Instead, deal with them immediately.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Frequent Iterations</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Continuous integration, with code integrated into the overall system, built and automatically unit tested as soon as it is checked in.</li>
							<li>Minimizing this gap also reduces integration waste.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Empower the Team</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Managers are taught how to listen to the developers</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Managers can explain better about what actions might be taken.</li>
							<li>Managers can provide suggestions for improvements.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>"Find good people and let them do their own job"</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Encourage progress, catching errors and removing impediments, but not micro-managing.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>People need motivation and a higher purpose to work for.</li>
						<li>Developers should be given access to the customer.</li>
						<li>Team leader should provide support and help in difficult situations as well as ensure that skepticism does not ruin the team's spirit.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Empower the Team Con't</h2>	
					<ul>
						<li>Lean assumes that teams are mature:
							<ul>
								<li>A mature organization looks at the whole system and doesn't only focus on optimizing desperate or separate parts</li>
								<li>A mature organization focuses on learning effectively and empowers the people who do the work to make decisions</li>
							</ul></li>
						<li>Team members should design their own working procedures i.e., self-determination</li>
						<li>In order to motivate their work must be clear and achievable</li>
						<li>Teams need Project Leaders (Program Managers), Master Developers, and Respected Leaders</li>
						<li>Managers track and control whereas Leaders cope with change, set direction and enable motivation</li>
						<li>Mentorship and pair programming enable communities of expertise to develop and be fostered</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>See the Whole</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>May and Tom Poppendieck gives 2 examples of the software engineering tendency to sub-optimize:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Vicious Circle Number 1</li>
							<ul>
								<li>A customer wants some new features "yesterday".</li>
								<li>The developers hears what the customer wants and gets their request done fast and at all cost.</li>
								<li>Result: There are sloppy changes made to the code.</li>
								<li>The complexity of the code base and the number of defects in the code increases.</li>
							</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>See the Whole Con't</h2>
						<ul>			
							<li>Vicious Circle Number 2</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Testing is overloaded with work.</li>
								<li>Result: Testing occurs a long time after the code is originally written, or testing is reduced.</li>
								<li>Developers do not get immediate feedback or some things are not properly tested.</li>
								<li>There are more defects in the code and testers have more work.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>See the Whole Con't</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Systems Thinking and Systems Dynamics say that a system is not just a sum of it's parts, it a product of those interactions</li>
							<li>A rigid and sequential process may cure one symptom but will not treat the root cause.</li>
							<li>Treating the symptoms and not the cause is a common pattern that becomes more likely with larger, more complex systems</li>
							<li>Important to avoid in order to see the overall benefit for the system as a whole</li>
						</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>See the Whole Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Lean seeks to optimize the whole value stream and not just individual functions or teams.</li>
						<li>The best way to organize teams is for them to be multi-disciplined with co-located product teams that have all the roles and skills they need to deliver a request from start to finish, without reference to other teams.</li>
						<li>Putting all of this together can be extremely significant not only in terms of the team's performance, but also in terms of the quality of the product, which ultimately can make your organization more competitive.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section><h2>IV. Importance, Pros and Cons of Lean in Software Development</h2></section>

				<section>
					<h2>Importance to Software Engineering</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Lean offers insight into strategies for improving our software process.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Ex: By understanding the source of waste in IT, we can begin to identify it and then eliminate it.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Lean principles provide a philosophical foundation for scaling agile approaches.</li>
						<li>Provides techniques for identifying waste.</li>
						<li>Helps calculate overall time efficiency of what we are doing.</li>
						<li>Lean developers can build software better and cheaper than competitors using traditional methods.</li>
						<li>The method emphasize on:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Building only what is needed</li>
							<li>Eliminating anything that does not add value</li>
							<li>Stopping production if something goes wrong</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits to the Lean Method</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Improved Quality</li>
						<ul>
							<li>A lot of activities are geared towards improving quality.</li>
							<li>As quality issues arise, problem solving techniques are used to solve the root of the problem.</li>
							<li>Mistake proofing is used to strengthen the process and prevent recurrence.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Improved Visual Management</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If management by sight is done correctly, the entire area can be evaluated with a visual scan.</li>
							<li>Any defects will stand out and be easy to identify as a problem.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Increased Efficiency</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Line balancing will ensure each person in the process is working in the most efficient manner.</li>
							<li>Standardized work will ensure they are doing it correctly, following the same method every time.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Manpower Reductions</li>
						<ul>
							<li>One of the major benefits is getting more done with less people.</li>
							<li>The freed up people can be used to perform further kaizen (practice of continuous improvement) activity, training to enhance skill level, or maintenance of the system once it is implemented.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Easier to Manage</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The work instructions and standardized work let people know what they have to do and when to do it.</li>
							<li>This makes managing and area easier and problems will still arise.</li>
							<li>But, the problems will be much easier to deal with in a team environment where the support groups are eager to help solve problems.</li>
						<li>Increased possibility of delivering product early. Lean helps development teams deliver more functionality in a shorter period of time, hence enabling more projects to be delivered.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Total Company Involvement</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Lean is meant to involve the whole company and not intended to be put into action in only one area.</li>
							<li>This helps promote the concept that everyone in the company is part of the team.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Problem Elimination</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Forces you to attack an issue and continue to investigate it until it has been eliminated.</li>
							<li>This ensure that a problem receives the level of attention it deserves to correct it.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Reduced Space</li>
						<ul>
							<li>With the reduction of waste, space are created.</li>
							<li>Reduction of finished and raw inventory will save space vertically in your ranking as well as horizontally across your floor.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Safer Work Environment</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Visual management and 5S will help identify when things are out of place.</li>
							<li>When unnecessary elements are removed, the workplace becomes more organized and an organized work environment is a safer working environment.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Improved Employee Morale</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This benefits may not be realized during the initial stages of the implementation.</li>
							<li>Employee involvement and empowerment will make all members of the company feel like a contributing part of the team.</li>
							<li>Reducing uncertainty in the workplace will reduce stress in the team members and lead to improved employee morale.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Challenges to the Lean Method</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Resistance</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Changes are seen as evil and unnecessary.</li>
							<li>Long term employees love to live in their comfort zone and will be tough to convert to the new lean culture.</li>
							<li>It takes a lot of effort to convince people about the changes and how the company and its employees will benefit from the changes.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Cost</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Sometimes money has to be spent in order to make/save money.</li>
							<li>Mistake proofing processes will cost money.</li>
							<li>Redesign of equipment to facilitate new line balancing will cost money.</li>
							<li>BUT over time, these improvements will pay for themselves through increased quality and reduced defects.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Challenges Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Upkeep</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Levelized production requires regular updating and maintenance.</li>
							<li>With proper execution in the general labor area, you should be able to free up people to fill these roles.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Initial Labor Increase</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Additional resources will be require to implement lean.</li>
							<li>Initially temporary workers can be used to free up some full time folks to implement the system.</li>
							<li>These people can be utilized to carry on the implementation of lean as well as the upkeep later on.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Team Cohesiveness</li>
							<ul><li>The method is highly dependent on motivated individuals and strong teamwork, which can be difficult to create and maintain.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

					<h2>The Lean Model in Healthcare</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The Lean model has found many fans in the healthcare realm as,
						<blockquote>Whether building a car or providing health care for a patient, workers must rely on multiple, complex processes to accomplish their tasks and provide value to the customer or patient. Waste — of money, time, supplies, or good will — decreases value.</blockquote></li>
						<li>Additionally, in health care the lean model can have a positive impact on productivity, cost, quality, and timely delivery of services.</li>

					<h2>7 Types of Waste (more information)</h2>
					<ul>
						<ol>
							<li>Over Production</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Over production is to manufacture an item before it is actually required.</li>
								<li>It prohibits the smooth flow of materials and degrades quality and productivity.</li>
								<li>The simple solution is to schedule and produce only what can be immediately sold/shipped and improved machine changeover/set-up capability.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Unnecessary Transportation</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Excessive movement and handling cause damage and are an opportunity for quality to deteriorate.</li>
								<li>Transportation can be difficult to reduce due to the perceived costs of moving equipment and processes closer together.</li>
								<li>The solution is to map the product flow to make it easier to visualize.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
					</ul>

					<h2>7 Types of Waste Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<ol start = 3>
							<li>Inventory</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Excess inventory tends to hide problems on the plan floor, which must be identified and resolved in order to improve operating performance.</li>
								<li>Excess inventory increases lead times, consumes productive floor space, delays the identification of problems, and inhibits communication.</li>
								<li>The solution is to achieve a seamless flow between work center and this can improve customer service and slash inventories and their associated costs.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Motion</li>
							<ul>
								<li>This waste is related to ergonomics and is seen in all instances of bending, stretching, walking, lifting, and reaching.</li>
								<li>The solution is to analyze excessive motion and redesigned for improvement with the involvement of plan personnel.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
					</ul>

					<h2>7 Types of Waste Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<ol start = 5>
							<li>Defects</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Defects have a direct impact to the bottom line, quality defects resulting in rework or scrap are a tremendous cost to organizations.</li>
								<li>The solution is with employee involvement and Continuous Process Improvement, there will be a huge opportunity to reduce defects.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Over Processing</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Many organizations use expensive high precision equipment which often results in poor plan layout because preceding or subsequent operations are located far apart.</li>
								<li>The solution is to invest in smaller, more flexible equipment where possible, creating manufacturing cells, and combining steps will greatly reduce the waste of inappropriate processing.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>7 Types of Waste Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<ol start = 7>
							<li>Waiting</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Waiting occurs when the material flow is poor, production runs are too long, and distance between work centers are too great.</li>
								<li>Goldratt has stated that one hour lost in a bottleneck process is one hour lost to the entire factory's output, which can never be recovered.</li>
								<li>The solution is to link processes together so that one feeds directly into the next.</li>
							</ul>
