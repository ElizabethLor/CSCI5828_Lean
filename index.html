					<h2>Lean Method</h2>
					<h4>By: Cassiane Cladis and Elizabeth Lor</h4>
          			<p>CSCI 5828 - Presentation 2</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Index</h2>
					<ol>
						
					</ol>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>History</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Lean manufacturing was creaed by <u>Taiichi Ohno</u></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Definition</h2>
					<p>The Lean Model is:</p>
					<p>"A customer-centric methodology used to continuously improve any process through the elimination of waste in everything you do"</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Lean Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>It's based on the ideas of "Continuous Incremental Improvement" and "Respect for People".</li>
						<li>Lean considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination.</li>
						<li>"Value" is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for.</li>
						<li>It's centered around preserving value with less work.</li>
						<li>Lean model decides what matters rather than uncritically accepting pre-existing ideas.</li>
						<li>Toyota was a leader in implementing lean practices in the 80s.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2>Lean Manufacturing Principles</h2>
					<ul>
						<p>Used for guiding the implementation of lean techniques.<p>
						<center><img height="500" src="images/Lean.jpg"></center>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Step 1: Identify Value</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Define <u>value</u> from the suctomer perspective and express the value in terms of specific product or service.</li>
						<li>Value is determined by the customers who want to buy the right product with the right capabilities at the right price.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This means that the proce must be "right" every time.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Work on making their processes right by eliminating waste.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Step 2: Map the Value Stream</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><u>Map</u> all of the steps, value added and non-value added that bring a product or service to the customer.</li>
						<li>Steps that do not not create value are eliminated.</li>
						<li>Detailed process flow diagram should be generated for each product or product category.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Step 3: Create Flow</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>A continuous <u>flow</u> of products, services and information from the end to end.</li>
						<li>Make the value creating steps occur in tight sequence so the product will flow smoothly toward the customer.</li>
						<li>Specific process waste is identified at each stage of the process flow and is eliminated.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Create Flow Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Lean enterprise implements 5S - A tool developed for reducing the clack hidden in manufacturing process.</li>
						<ol>
							<li><b>Sort:</b> sorting or segregating through the contents of the workplace and removing all unnecessary items</li>
							<li><b>Straighten:</b> putting or arranging the neccessary items in their place and providing easy access by clea identification</li>
							<li><b>Shine:</b> cleaing everything, keeping it clean and using cleaing to inspect the workplace and equipment for defects</li>
							<li><b>Standardize:</b> creating visual controls and guidlines for keeping the workplace organized, orderly and clean, in other words, maintain the shine</li>
							<li><b>Sustain:</b> insituting training and discipline to ensure that everyone flows the 5S standards</li>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Step 4: Establish Pull</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Actual demands <u>pulls</u> product/service through the value stream</li>
						<li>Nothing is done by the upstream process until the downstream customer signals the need.</li>
						<li>As flow is introduced, it lets customers pull value fro the next upstream activity.</li>
						<li>This step can be directed toward either removing excess capacity (inventory) or increasing the rate of pull.</li>
						<li>A pull system, which on the production side is making a product at the same rate at which it is being sold.</li>
						<li>On the supply side, a pull system is flowing resources into a production process by replacing only what has been consumed.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Step 5: Seek Perfection</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The completed elimination of waste so all activities create value for the customer by breakthrough and <u>continuous improvement</u> projects.</li>
						<li>As value is specified, value streams are identified, wasted steps are removed, and flow and pull are introduced, begin the process again and continue it until a state of perfection isreached in which perfect value is created with no waste.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Eliminate Waste</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>3 general forms of waste identified by the Toyota Production System</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Muda - unproductive</li>
							<li>Mura - unevenness, inconsistency</li>
							<li>Muri - over burden, unreasonableness</li>
						</ul>
						<li>There are 7 types of waste:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Over Production</li>
							<li>Unnecessary Transportation</li>
							<li>Inventory</li>
							<li>Motion</li>
							<li>Defects</li>
							<li>Over Processing</li>
							<li>Waiting</li>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Eliminate Waste Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Everything that does not add value to the customer is waste, such as</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Unnecessary code or functionality</li>
							<li>Slow or ineffective communication</li>
							<li>Defects and quality issues</li>
							<li>Unclear or constantly changing requirements</li>
						</ul>
						<li>In order to eliminate waste, one should be able to recognize it.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If some activity could be bypassed or the result could be achieved without it, it is waste.</li>
							<li>If the partially done code is abandoned during the develpoment process, it is waste.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Waste removal should take place iteratively until seemingly essential processes and procedures are liquidated.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Amplify Learning</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>This is the best approach for imporving a software developme environment.</li>
						<li>Instead of adding more documentation or detailed planning, different ideas could be tried by writing code and building.</li>
						<li>Learning process is sped up by usage of short iteration cycles</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Each iteration is coupled with refactoring and integration testing.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>During these short iterations, both customer representatives and the development team learn more about the domain problem and figure out possible solution for furthre development.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This helps the customer better understand their needs based on the existing result of development efforts.</li>
							<li>The developers learns how to better satisfy those needs.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Decide As Late As Possible</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Better results should be achieved with an options vased approach, delaying decisions as much as possible until they can be made based on facts and not on uncertain assumptions and predictions.</li>
						<li>The more complex a system is, the more capacity for change should be built into it.</li>
						<li>This does not mean that no planning should be involved.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Planning activities should be concentrated on the different options and adapting to the current situation as well as clarifying confusing situations by establishing patterns for rapid action.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Deliver As Fast As Possible</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The sooner the end product is delivered without major defects, the sooner feedback can be received and incorporated into the next iteration.</li>
						<li>The shorter the iterations, the better the learning and communication within the team.</li>
						<li>With speed, decisions can be delayed.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Speed assures the fulfilling of the customer's present needs and not what they required yesterday.</li>
							<li>Gives them the opportunity to delay making up their minds about what they really require until they gain better knowledge.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Customers value rapid delivery of a quality product.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Empower the Team</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Managers are taught how to listen to the developers</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Managers can explain better about what actions might be taken.</li>
							<li>Managers can provide suggestions for improvements.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>"Find good people and let them do their own job"</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Encourage progress, catching errors and removing impediments, but not micro-managing.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>People need motivation and a higher purpose to work for.</li>
						<li>Developers should be given access to the customer.</li>
						<li>Team leader should provide support and help in difficult situations as well as ensure that skepticism does not ruin the team's spirit.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Build Quality In</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Pair Programming</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Seeks to avoid quality issues by applying the minds of two developers to each task.</li>
							<li>Combined the experience of two developers instead of one.</li>
							<li>Often results in better productivity as they see solutions that on their own they might not have done.</li>
							<li>Improved quality, since one person can be thinking slightly ahead of the other, catching issues before they occur.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Test Driven Development</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Write the tests before writing the code.</li>
							<li>This precent quality issues from happening.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Build Quality In Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Constant Feedback</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Develop in small incremental steps and through close collaboration.</li>
							<li>This provide the opportunity for constant 2-way feedback between the Product Owner and the team.</li>
							<li>This feedback can be valable to ensure the right level of quality.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Minimize Time Between Stages</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Building quality into the development process is to minimize the time between development, testing and bug fixing.</li>
							<li>Do not log the bug. Instead, deal with them immediately.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Frequent Iterations</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Continuous integration, with code integrated into the overall system, built and automatically unit tested as soon as it is checked in.</li>
							<li>Minimizing this gap also reduces integration waste.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Optimize the Whole</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>May and Tom Poppendieck gives 2 examples of the software engineering tendency to sub-optimize:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Vicious Circle Number 1</li>
							<ul>
								<li>A customer wants some new features "yesterday".</li>
								<li>The developers hears what the customer wants and gets their request done fast and at all cost.</li>
								<li>Result: There are sloppy changes made to the code.</li>
								<li>The complexity of the code base increases.</li>
								<li>The number of defects in the code increases.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Vicious Circle Number 2</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Testing is overloaded with work.</li>
								<li>Result: Testing occurs a long time after the code is originally written, or testing is reduced.</li>
								<li>Developers do not get immediate feedback or some things are not properly tested.</li>
								<li>There are more defects in the code.</li>
								<li>Testers have more work.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Optimize the Whole Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Lean seeks to optimize the whole value stream and not just individual functions or teams.</li>
						<li>The best way to organize teams is for them to be multi-disciplined with co-located product teams that have all the roles and skills they need to deliver a request from start to finish, without reference to other teams.</li>
						<li>Putting all of this together can be extremely significant not only in terms of the team's performance, but also in terms of the quality of the product, which ultimately can make your organization more competitive.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Important to Software Engineering</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Lean offers insight into strategies for improving our software process.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Ex: By understanding the source of waste in IT, we can begin to identify it and then eliminate it.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Lean principles provide a philosophical foundation for scaling agile approaches.</li>
						<li>Provides techniques for identifying waste.</li>
						<li>Helps calculate overall time efficiency of what we are doing.</li>
						<li>Lean developers can build software better and cheaper than competitors using traditional methods.</li>
						<li>The method emphasize on:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Building only what is needed</li>
							<li>Eliminating anything that does not add value</li>
							<li>Stopping production if something goes wrong</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Benefits to Lean Method</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Improved Quality</li>
						<ul>
							<li>A lot of activities are geared towards improving quality.</li>
							<li>As quality issues arise, problem solving techniques are used to solve the root of the problem.</li>
							<li>Mistake proofing is used to strengthen the process and prevent recurrence.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Improved Visual Management</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If management by sight is done correctly, the entire area can be evaluated with a visual scan.</li>
							<li>Any defects will stand out and be easy to identify as a problem.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Increased Efficiency</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Line balancing will ensure each person in the process is working in the most efficient mannner.</li>
							<li>Standardized work will ensure they are doing it correctly, following the same method every time.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Manpower Reductions</li>
						<ul>
							<li>One of the major benefits is getting more done with less people.</li>
							<li>The freed up people can be used to perform further kaizen (practice of continuous improvement) activity, training to enhance skill level, or maintenance of the system once it is implemented.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Easier to Manage</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The work instructions and standardized work let people know what they have to do and when to do it.</li>
							<li>This makes managing and area easier and problems will still arise.</li>
							<li>But, the problems will be much easier to deal with in a team environment where the support groups are eager to help solve problems.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Total Company Involvement</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Lean is meant to involve the whole company and not intended to be put into action in only one area.</li>
							<li>This helps promote the concept that everyone in the company is part of the team.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Problem Elimination</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Forces you to attack an issue and continue to investiage it until it has been eliminated.</li>
							<li>This ensure that a problem receives the level of attention it deserves to correct it.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Reduced Space</li>
						<ul>
							<li>With the reduction of waste, space are created.</li>
							<li>Reduction of finished and raw inventory will save space vertically in your ranking as well as horizontally across your floor.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Safer Work Environment</li>
						<ul>
							
						</ul>
						<li>Improved Employee Morale</li>
						<ul>
							
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<!--				
				<section>
					<h2>Phase 5: Deployment</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Once the functional and non-functional testing is done, the product is deployed in the customer environment or released into the market.</li>
						<li>In order to deploy the system the engineers need to make sure:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Deploy the application in the respective environment.</li>
							<li>That there are no severe defects open.</li>
							<li>Make sure that the test exit criteria are met.</li>
							<li>Perform a sanity check in the environment after the application is deployed to ensure the application does not break.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>The User Manual is also produced at this time.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>Phase 6: Maintenance</h2>
					<img height="400" src="images/phase6.jpg">
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h2>Phase 6: Maintenance</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Software development team undertakes routine maintenance activities by visiting the client site.</li>
						<li>If enhancements or changes are needed, the software process has to be followed all over again.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>How issues can be fixed:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Patches are released to fix issues.</li>
								<li>Better versions are released to enhance the product.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<li>This is usually the longest stage of the software.</li>
						<li>Software is updated to:</li>
						<ol>
							<li>Meet the changing customer needs</li>
							<li>Adapted to accommodate changes in the external environment</li>
							<li>Correct errors</li>
							<li>Enhance the efficiency of the software</li>
						</ol>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Advantages of Waterfall</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Easy to understand and use.</li>
						<li>Allows for departmentalization and control.</li>
						<li>The fulfillment of one phase is needed before proceeding to the next.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Each phase of development proceeds in a strict order.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Phases are processed and completed one at a time.</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						<li>Design errors are captured before any software is written, saving time during the implementation phase.</li>
						<li>Excellent documentation and requirements documents for each stage.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Process and results are well documented.</li>
							<li>Each phase has specific deliverables and review process.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Works well for projects where requirements, budget, and scope are very well understood.</li>
						<li>Easy to arrange tasks.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Disadvantages of Waterfall</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Requirement analysis is done initially.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Sometimes it is not possible to state the entire requirement at the beginning.</li>
							<li>There are high amounts of risk and uncertainty.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Difficult to use when requirements and scope are still forming.</li>
								</ul>							
							<li>Not a good model for complex projects.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Customer can see working model only at the end.</li>
						<li>Poor model for long, ongoing projects where there is no set timeline.</li>
						<li>Not possible to backtrack since the phases flow from one to another.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Does not allow much for reflection or revision.</li>
							<li>Once in the testing phase, it is very difficult to go back and change something.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Disadvantage: Silos</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>An oft-cited disadvantage is the "silo" effect, when large companies tend to create departments for each of the phases.</li>
						<li>The requirements specification phase is done by business analysts, design by architects, implementation by developers, etc.</li>
						<li>However, each of the department works in isolation from each other and are "silo-ed"</li>
							<ul>
								<li>There is limited availability for the departments to support one another after the work is passed along, which prevents team cohesion.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Common result of having phases and “silos” is increase in management and documentation effort. </li>
							<ul>
								<li>Since team communication is reduced as the result of phases and silos, it needs to be compensated with the increase in documentation.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>It is not uncommon that medium to big projects spend one third or even half of the budget in documentation and management.</li>	
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Example of Waterfall Model: 
						<br>Product Development – Developing a Customer Address Book</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Product manager creates requirement documents that include the following requirements in order of priority.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>User should be able to create new contacts.</li>
								<li>User should be able to view their contacts.</li>
								<li>User should be able to import contacts from other programs.</li>
								<li>User should be able to email their contacts from the address book.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Create an internal instant messaging system for customer.</li>
						<li>Product Requirements document created by product manager with client:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Users should be able to send, receive, and reply to messages to other users within the organization.</li>
								<li>Users should be able to see past messages.</li>
								<li>Users should be able to see if other users are available.</li>
								<li>Users can have one of three set profile pictures.</li>

				<section>
					<h2>Integration and Testing Phase</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Integration and Testing: All units are integrated and the entire system is tested for faults and failures.</li>
						<li>Entire design and construction is put to test:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Unit testing: Passes</li>
							<li>System testing: Fails</li>
							<li>Acceptance testing: Fails</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Faults are noticed in 2 units but the errors have not been located. The lead engineer for one of the units has changed companies so others are scrambling to read and fix the code.<font color="red">Pushes timeframe back by 2 weeks.</font></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Additionally: The client decided they want avatars with editable features for profile pictures. They want to be able to change gender, race, hair and eye color, and add or remove glasses.<font color="red"> Pushes timeframe back by 3 more weeks and the process will have to start over again back at phase 1 or phase 2.</font></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Integration and Testing (II)</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The avatar profile picture unit was created too quickly and has a series of errors.</li>
						<li>The client deems the design "clunky" and wants to alter the look of the GUI.</li>
						<li>Also, the client needs it to be compatible with iPads.</li>
						<li><font color="red">Pushes timeframe back by 4 weeks and the process will have to start over again back at phase 1 or phase 2.</font></li>
						<li>Client decides they don't want avatar profile pictures, request that users can update a photo from their desktop.</li>
						<li>Another fault is located.</li>
						<li><font color="red">Timeframe goes back another 3 weeks.</font></li>

					<h2>Importance to Software Engineering</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The waterfall method offers numerous advantages for software developers.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Staged development cycle enforces discipline.</li>
								<li>The developer and client can identify the progress of the project.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Can make software engineering seem simple and accessible for new engineers and teams.</li>
						<li>Emphasis on requirements and design before coding to catch and correct flaws at the design phase rather than testing phase.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Ensure minimal time and effort wastage.</li>
								<li>Reduce risk of customer expectations not being met.</li>
								<li>Getting the requirements and design out of the way first also improves quality.</li>
							</ul>	
					</ul>

					<h2>Importance to Software Engineering Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Project management team spends a lot of time before the project beings trying to understand, document and plan everything that needs to be included.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Client meetings, interviews, surveys and all types of information gathering goes into the front end so sketches or mocks up of workflow can be produced and approved by the customer.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Attempt to break down the complexity of large software programs and abstract concepts.</li>

					<h2>Importance to Software Engineering Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Domain capturing is one of the hardest part of the engineering process.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>To understand it, models are needed.</li>
							</ul>						
						<li>Software engineering is about models.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>A program is a model.</li>
								<li>Even at the assembly level, programming is constructing a model.</li>
								<li>Modeling is the way humans deal with complexity.</li>
								<li>Modeling helps humans reduce and understand the project.</li>

					<h2>Fun Fact #1: Sashimi Model</h2>
					<img height="400" src="images/sashimi.png">
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Sashimi Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The sashimi model was originated by Peter DeGrace.</li>
						<li>It got its name because it features overlapping phases, like the overlapping fish of Japanese sashimi</li>
						<center><img height="400" src="images/sashimi_fish.jpg"></center>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Sashimi Model Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Sometimes it is referred to as "the waterfall model with feedback."</li>
						<center><img height="400" src="images/waterfall_feedback.png"></center>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Sashimi Model Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Similar to the waterfall, except that the phases overlap to show that requirements cannot be completed until the architecture is <u>at least partially explored.</u></li>
						<ul>
							<li>One can return to the previous step if desired.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Another important feature of the sashimi model is the different treatment of the documentation.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The model treats the documentation as a unified document.</li>
							<li>This results in a significant reduction in the documentation volume.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Fun Fact #2: Aorta Lifecycle Model</h2>
					<img height="400" src="images/aorta.png">
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Aorta Lifecycle Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The aorta lifecycle model relies a lot on the feedback which comes from other phases before progressing onto the next.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The model follows the waterfall model, but after each cycle is a feedback to the customer.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>There are 9 steps to the aorta lifecycle model with the concrete work comprising of 5 essential phases.</li>

					<h2>Fun Fact #3: V Waterfall Model</h2>
					<img height="400" src="images/V-Shaped.png">
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>V Waterfall Model</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The V Waterfall model relies on a linear software developmental program, which stresses on balanced development more than anything else.</li>
						<li>Just like the waterfall model, the life cycle is a sequential path of execution of process.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Each phase must be completed before the next phase begins.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The testing of the product is planned in parallel with a corresponding phase of development.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Waterfall vs. Agile</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>There is a debate about which model is better for a project, but</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Does it really matter?</li>
							<li>Doesn't either way give you a product?</li>
							<li>Different life cycles are good for different projects.</li>

					<h2>Summary Con't</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The waterfall model has its advantages and disadvantages.</li>
						<ul>

								<ul>
									<li>It does not allow much for reflection or revision.</li>
								</ul>	
						</ul>
						<li>It is important to Software Engineering because of the emphasis on requirements and design before coding.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>This ensure minimal wastage of time and effort.</li>
								<li>Modeling helps humans reduce and understand the project.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>It provides a structured, simple, and relatively easy to follow model for engineering teams.</li>
